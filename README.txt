This is my website. I have used a framework called Tessellate by HTML5 UP with extensive modifications. Please see below to learn about the framework.

This is Tessellate, a brand new responsive site template by AJ for HTML5 UP. It's a single pager (a format I'm pretty into right now), has styling for a crapload of basic elements, and includes a handy "dark" modifier class to flip a given element to a light-on-dark color scheme.
